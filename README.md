# freefall
Code to solve simple freefall problems.

Initial commit 7/1/2019
  - Calculates time when object thrown straight up reaches its maximum height
  
  Need to add:
    - Value of maximum height
    - Measurements in feet or meters (right now it is only meters)
    - Change the gravitational constant?
