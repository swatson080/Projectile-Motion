# freefall
Code to solve simple freefall problems.

Initial commit 7/1/2019

  - Calculates time when object thrown straight up reaches its maximum height
  - Calculates the maximum height (in meters/second only for now) that the object reaches
  
Eventually, I'd like to add more functionality to this, including:
  - Change the gravitational constant
  - Switch between units used
  - Allow for multiple calculations in a single run of the program
