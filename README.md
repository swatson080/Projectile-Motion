# freefall
Code to solve simple freefall problems.

Initial commit 7/1/2019

  - Calculates time when object thrown straight up reaches its maximum height
  - Calculates the maximum height (in meters/second only for now) that the object reaches
  
 Update 7/5/2019
  - User can now select which units they would like to use (metric,imperial)
  - User can perform as many calculations as they like in a single run
  Issues:
    - All inputs are integers - tried with strings, but the program did not flow smoothly
  
Eventually, I'd like to add more functionality to this, including:
  - Change the gravitational constant
  - Additional kinds of kinematics calculations
